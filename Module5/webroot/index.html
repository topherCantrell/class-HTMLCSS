		    <p>Julie said "some guy in a Hawaiian shirt is here to see you". Imagine my surprise when I got
		    to the counter and it was Mr. Weird Al Yankovick! I am a big Weird Al fan. It is a great
		    honor for Spatula City to be in a scene in his upcoming movie titled UHF.</p>
		    <p>Julie and I stayed up all night shining the spatulas and cleaning the parking lot. I am nervous
		    about my quick interview at the end of the scene. I will try to memorize the lines, but I'll probably end up
		    reading them.</p>

		    </header>
		    <p>Some stiff-neck salesman tried to sell us a line of Electronic spatulas today. He pulled out a thick
		    spatula with buttons and knobs all over it and told me it would be the latest craze in kitchen automation.
		    He left me the sample, but I am afraid to turn it on.</p>

		    <p>President Ronald Reagan visited The Spatula today! A long motorcade circled the lot about 10:00AM. Several
		    men in black suits escourted Mr. Reagan down our isle of 4th of July spatulas, and he selected one of our
		    highest quality blue-steele tools.</p>
		    <p>He explained that the Whitehouse staff had broken three spatulas since he took office. He had seen our
		    commercials and wanted our lifetime guarantee.</p>
		    <p>If you visit the Witehouse, ask to see the Presidential Spatula. And tell them you too are a Spatula City
		    Customer.</p>
