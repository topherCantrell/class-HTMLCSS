      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      
      <p>It was a blustery, Winter morning in 1682. Mr. Thompson was a mere boy of 13 back then.
      When he got to school after a ten mile hike through the snow he remembered he had used the family's only pencil as a splint
      to fix his mother's broken leg. Rather than fail his math quiz Mr. Thompson used his pocket 
      knife to carve a pencil from a fallen tree limb he found behind the schoolhouse.</p>
      
      <p>That night (after homework and chores) he carved 100 more pencils. And he made several packs of paper from dried
      sage grass. The very next day the Rusty Ruler opened for business, and it has been helping
      distraught students ever since.
