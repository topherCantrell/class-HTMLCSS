# Exercise 1: Mushrooms

Jacob is fascinated by mushrooms! You can see the first two pages of his photo 
journal in ```diary.docx```. In this exercise you will convert his written 
journal into a single HTML page.

*  Make a rough paper sketch of your design.
*  Decide how the parts of the journal map to HTML elements.
*  Use the images in the project directory.
*  Add other images and entries to Jacob's web journal!
