    <p>Pictures of awesome mushrooms I have encountered.</p>

    <p>I am visiting my sister in Vermont. This beauty was growing right 
       beside her house. I say “was” -- I told my nephew it looked like a 
       candy cane, and the kid picked it up and ate it! I hope it wasn’t 
       poisonous.</p>

	<p>My nephew, Roger, survived the mushroom!</p>

	<p>The mushroom is already dying. Sorry, little guy.</p>

	<p>It finally stopped raining after almost a week! I took a hike in the 
	   woods behind the house and ran into this beauty. The detail around the 
	   edges made me think of a jellyfish.</p>

	<p>This little guy was growing in the middle of the sidewalk. It looks like
	   you could sit down on it.</p>
