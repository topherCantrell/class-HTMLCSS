# Exercise 5: KidSpace

The KidSpace website needs some styling!

Use the existing "index.html" and create your own CSS file to style the HTML. Add classes and IDs as needed.
Change the <div>s to modern HTML5 tags as you see fit.

Next add a table of "Planet Information" to the top of the main content. Use the web to find the following data to the table:

*  Planet Name
*  Mass
*  Time for One Orbit
*  Distance From Sun
